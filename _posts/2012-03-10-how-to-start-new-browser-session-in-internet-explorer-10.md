I just came across a New Session feature on Internet Explorer 10 Consumer Preview. Generally we had to close the browser to start a new session and this would mean that all the open web pages has to be closed. But now using the New Session option, users can keep all open tabs and start a fresh session in a separate browser window.

You can start a new session by clicking the File menu then selecting **New Session** from the menu list.
