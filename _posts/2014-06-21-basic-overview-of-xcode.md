Xcode is the primary tool used for the development of Mac and iOS applications. This is a free tool which can be downloaded from developer.apple.com website. You can use Xcode for Writing code, Building, Testing (Unit test) and for Distribution (Submitting to App Store). Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE), has several panes designed to help with different aspects of app development. Each pane serves a specific purpose and enhances the development workflow.

Here are the primary panes in Xcode:

## Different Panes in Xcode

### **Navigator**

This is available at the left hand side of Xcode window. The Navigator Pane is where you can switch between different navigators to perform various tasks:

- **Project Navigator**: Browse files in your project.

- **Symbol Navigator**: View the symbols in your project like classes, methods, properties.

- **Issue Navigator**: See compile errors and warnings.

- **Test Navigator**: Run and manage your tests.
