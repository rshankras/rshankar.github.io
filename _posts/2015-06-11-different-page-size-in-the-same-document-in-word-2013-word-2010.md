This post is in reply to a query posted by a blog reader that

> Is it possible to set a different page size, for one page, within a document of another page size. I have a multipage document in A4, I want to insert an A3 page size in the middle in landscape orientation, so I can fit a drawing onto the page.

Word 2013 & Word 2010 allows users to have different page size in the same document using Section. We had already seen how to use Section break for [removing page number from selected pages](http://blogmines.com/blog/2012/03/29/remove-page-number-from-selected-pages-in-word-2010/). And now to have A4 and A3 page size, follow the below mentioned steps.

**Step 1**: Open the Word document for editing.

**Step 2** : Navigate to the page below which you want to insert A3 page.

**Step 3**: Select Page Layout from the menu then click the Breaks option under Page Setup.

Â 

**Step 4**: From the drop down, select **Next Page** under Section Breaks.

**Step 5**: After the new page has been inserted, click the **Size** option under Page Setup and select A3 from the list of available page sizes.

By this way Word 2013 and Word 2010 users can have different page sizes in the same document.
