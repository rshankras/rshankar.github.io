**Word 2016, 2013 & 2010** have an option that allows users to **show or hide white space between pages in Print Layout**. Hiding the white spaces between pages will also **hide the header and footer** in the document. You can solve the missing header and footer problem by any of the following ways.

Click File menu –> Options –> Display Options.

Then navigate to Page display Options and make sure to mark the check box with label as **Show white space between pages in Print Layout view**.  

### Show the white space using mouse

The other alternative way is to Show the white space by double clicking on the page break line. When you hover the mouse over the page break the following message appears.
