If you are receiving **junk** or **spam emails** in your Outlook email client and you do want to receive emails from these senders then you can use [Junk email settings in Outlook](http://blogmines.com/blog/2011/01/17/where-is-the-junk-email-settings-in-outlook-2010/) to block these senders. To **quickly block a sender** in **Outlook 2016, 2013 & 2010**, select by right clicking the email and pick Block Sender option from the menu list.

This would display the following confirmation message and the message will be moved to the **Junk email** folder.

Instead of selecting Junk email options from the context menu, you can also try the **Junk menu option** which is available as part of the Home Menu.
