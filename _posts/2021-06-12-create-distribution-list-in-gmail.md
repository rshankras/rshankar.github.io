**Distribution list or mailing list** is quite useful when you want to send email to multiple recipients at the same time. You can create a distribution list using Google Contacts and this can be used in Gmail for sending emails.

- Access Google Contacts. - contacts.google.com
- Click "Create Label" option available on the left hand sidebar.
