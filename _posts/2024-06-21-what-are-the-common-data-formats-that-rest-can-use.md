REST (Representational State Transfer) is not limited to using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for data exchange. REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications and APIs that can use various formats for representing data. While JSON is a popular choice due to its simplicity and ease of use, other formats can also be used in RESTful APIs. Here are some of the common data formats that REST APIs can use:

### Common Data Formats in REST

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**

- **Advantages**:
    - Lightweight and easy to read.
    
    - Natively supported by JavaScript, making it ideal for web applications.
    
    - Widely used and supported by many programming languages.

- **Example**:  
    `json { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }`

**XML (Extensible Markup Language)**

- **Advantages**:
    - Extensible and allows for complex data structures.
    
    - Used in many legacy systems and enterprise applications.
    
    - Supports namespaces and schema validation.

- **Example**:  
    `xml <user> <id>1</id> <name>John Doe</name> <email>john.doe@example.com</email> </user>`

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**

- **Advantages**:
    - Useful for APIs that need to render HTML content.
    
    - Can be easily displayed in web browsers.

- **Example**:  
    `html <html> <body> <h1>User Information</h1> <p>ID: 1</p> <p>Name: John Doe</p> <p>Email: john.doe@example.com</p> </body> </html>`

**YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)**

- **Advantages**:
    - Human-readable and easy to edit.
    
    - Useful for configuration files and data serialization.

- **Example**:  
    `yaml id: 1 name: John Doe email: john.doe@example.com`

**Plain Text**

- **Advantages**:
    - Simple and easy to use for straightforward data.

- **Example**:  
    `ID: 1 Name: John Doe Email: john.doe@example.com`

**CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**

- **Advantages**:
    - Good for tabular data and easily imported into spreadsheets.

- **Example**:  
    `id,name,email 1,John Doe,john.doe@example.com`

**Binary Formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, Avro, MessagePack)**

- **Advantages**:
    - Efficient in terms of size and speed.
    
    - Useful for performance-critical applications.

- **Example** (Protocol Buffers in a serialized binary form).

### Content Negotiation

REST APIs often use content negotiation to determine which format to use for responses. This process involves the client and server agreeing on the best format for the data exchange based on the client's capabilities and preferences.

- **HTTP Headers**: Clients can specify their preferred data format using the `Accept` header in the HTTP request.

- **Example**:  
    `http GET /users/1 HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Accept: application/json`

- The server then responds with the requested format if it supports it.  
    `http HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json`  
    `json { "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com" }`

### Conclusion

REST is flexible and not tied to a specific data format. JSON is popular due to its simplicity and compatibility with JavaScript, but other formats like XML, HTML, YAML, plain text, CSV, and binary formats can also be used depending on the use case and requirements. Content negotiation allows REST APIs to support multiple data formats, providing flexibility and interoperability between clients and servers.
