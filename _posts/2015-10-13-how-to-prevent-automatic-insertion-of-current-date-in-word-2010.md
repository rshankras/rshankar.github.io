This is in reference to a query posted by one of the blog reader on â€œ**how to prevent the date field getting automatically updated with the current date** **in a Word document**. We had already seen the steps required to [insert current date](http://blogmines.com/blog/2010/08/26/how-to-insert-current-date-and-time-in-word-2010/) or [modify date format](http://blogmines.com/blog/2011/08/01/change-the-insert-date-format-in-word-2010/) for the date in Word 2016, 2013 & 2010. Similarly you can stop Word from the changing the date to the system date by following the below simple steps

**Step 1**: Open the document with the date field.

**Step 2**: Select the date field then click the Insert menu and navigate to Text section.

**Step 4**: In the Date and Time window, un mark the check box with label as **Update automatically** then click OK button to confirm and save the changes.

By this way Word users can stop automatic update of date field to the current date.
