**AutoCorrect** in **Word 2010** has a feature which automatically converts two consecutive hyphens in em dash (\_\_). For example when you have words connected with hyphens like **June—December** (with two hyphens) will be changed to **June—December** (with em dashes). This feature is by default enabled on Microsoft Word 2010.

**Turn off hyphens with dash feature**

Users can turn off the auto replacement of hyphens with dashes using the option available as part of AutoCorrect settings. Click the File menu –> Options link and navigate to Proofing Option screen then click the AutoCorrect Options button in the Proofing screen.
