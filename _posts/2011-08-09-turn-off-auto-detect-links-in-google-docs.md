**[![Hyperlinks](/assets/images/Hyperlinks_thumb.jpg "Hyperlinks")](/assets/images/Hyperlinks.jpg)**

**Google Docs** has a feature that can **automatically** **detect** any links and apply the style accordingly. For example if you have type a text as http://digianswers.com in a Google Docs **document** then it would consider this as a hyperlink

But if you do not want the **hyperlink** then highlight the link and click on the **remove** link.

And if you want to permanently **turn off** the **auto detection** of links then click on the Tools menu and select **Preferences** from the list of available menus.
