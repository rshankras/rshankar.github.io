The **Safari** browser has a menu bar with menus such asÂ  File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks etc.. and it is available on the top of the browser as shown below.

But if your Safari browser does not display the Menus then you can **un hide menu bar** using the Safari General Settings menu option.

Click on the **General Settings menu** available at the top right hand side of the browser. From the list of displayed menu, select the menu with label as Show Menu bar.

This would display the Menu bar at the top of the Safari browser.
