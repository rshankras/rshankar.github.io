Having used Windows 10 for a week, I do not see a reason to **downgrade it to Windows 8.1** But in caseÂ  you want to Switch back to Windows 8.1 then follow the steps below.

**Step 1**: Click the Windows icon / Start button.

**Step 2**: Select Settings from the menu list

**Step 4**: Navigate to Recovery tab in Update & Security screen. Then click Get started button under **Go back to Windows 8.1**

Please note that this downgrade option is available only for a month after you have upgraded to Window 10. Another alternative is to use the **Advanced start-up** option to restore the system to Windows 8.1 using backup (If you had taken a backup of Windows 8.1 system image.)
