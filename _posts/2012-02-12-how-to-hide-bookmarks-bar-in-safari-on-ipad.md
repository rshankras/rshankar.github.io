Safari browser on iPad, like any other PC or Mac browsers allows users to save webpage URL as bookmark. It also provides a separate Bookmarks Bar for easily accessing these saved URLs.

If you are not using the Bookmarks Bar on Safari then you have the option to turn off the display of Bookmarks Bar. This would give more space for the web page browsing and you can still access the saved bookmarks using the Safari browser menu items.

**Hide Bookmarks Bar on Safari**

Navigate to iPad home screen and tap the settings icon. Then navigate to the General section under Safari settings.
