**Excel 2016, 2013 and 2010** provides an option to **prevent users** from adding new worksheet to existing **Workbook structure**. So if you are the owner of Excel file and you do not want to allow other users to **add** any **new** **worksheet**, **rename** or **move** **worksheet** then you can use **Protect Workbook Structure** option to change the permission. You can access Protect Workbook Structure from the Info menu.

Click the File menu and then navigate to Info menu and click the drop down arrow under **Protect Workbook** option. From the list of available option select Protect Workbook Structure. This would display the following **Protect Structure and Windows**. Mark the check box with label as **Structure**. If you want to password protect it then enter a password in the Password field. Click Ok button to save and confirm the changes.
