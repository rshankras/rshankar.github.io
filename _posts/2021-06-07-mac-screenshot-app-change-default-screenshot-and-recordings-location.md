**Screenshot app** in **Mac OS Big Sur** is quite useful tool for taking screenshots and screen recording. The default location for saving screenshots and video recording file is Mac desktop.

Launch Screenshot app.

Click the options menu and select Other location. Then create a folder of your choice. In this example, I have created a folder "Screenshot" under desktop.

Any screenshots or recordings will be stored under the newly created folder.
