Users of Word 2016 and 2013 can create a link to another document within their document using the **Insert Object** or **Hyperlink** feature. This is quite useful when you want to include reference documents inside your document.  

### Insert Object

**Step 1**: In the main document, navigate and place the cursor to the position where you want to insert the document.

**Step 2**: Click the Insert menu then the Object option available under Text section.
