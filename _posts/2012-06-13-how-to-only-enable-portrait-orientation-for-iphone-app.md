When developing an iPhone app in Xcode, if you have any requirement that only portrait orientation allowed then you can do the following.

**Step 1**: Open the implementation file for editing.

**Step 2**. Navigate to shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation method. This methods is auto generated by Xcode while creating the project.

**Step 3**: replace the return statement with return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait);. The update method should be displayed as shown below.

\- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation

{

    return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait);

}

This method will return true only when the orientation in Portrait mode.

**Step 4**: Now navigate to Project Folder on the navigattion bar. In the summary tab under Supported Device Orientations, make sure to un mark the other orientation except portrait.
