We had seen the steps for [adding notes in PowerPoint](http://blogmines.com/blog/2011/10/11/adding-notes-to-slides-in-powerpoint-2010/) and now we will see how to **print** only **notes** in **PowerPoint 2016, 2013 and 2010**. The default print settings in PowerPoint is set to full slides and you can change this using the Print option.

Click File menu and then the Print menu option.
