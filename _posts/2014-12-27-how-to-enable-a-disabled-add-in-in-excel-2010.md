Office products such as Word, Excel Outlook will automatically disable **installed add-in** if any add-in prevented the software from functioning correctly. And it also provides option for enabling the disabled add-in items. In Excel 2010 you can **enable a disabled add-in** using the add-in options.

Click the File menu –> Options link –> Navigate to Add-Ins options.
