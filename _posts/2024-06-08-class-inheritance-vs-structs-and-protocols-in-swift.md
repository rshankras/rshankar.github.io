To explain class inheritance using your example, we'll first demonstrate the class-based approach and then show how to achieve similar functionality using structs and protocols. This will help beginners understand the differences between classes and structs and when to use each.

### Class Inheritance

In Swift, class inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This is useful when you want to create a hierarchy of classes that share common behaviour.

#### Example:

```swift
class Shape {
    var name: String = ""

    func area() -> Double {
        return 0
    }

    func draw() -> String {
        return "Draw a \(name) with area \(area())"
    }
}

class Square: Shape {
    var length: Double = 0

    override func area() -> Double {
        return length * length
    }
}

let square = Square()
square.name = "My Square"
square.length = 5
print(square.draw()) // Output: Draw a My Square with area 25.0

class Rectangle: Shape {
    var length: Double = 0
    var breadth: Double = 0

    override func area() -> Double {
        return length * breadth
    }
}

let rectangle = Rectangle()
rectangle.name = "My Rectangle"
rectangle.length = 5
rectangle.breadth = 10
print(rectangle.draw()) // Output: Draw a My Rectangle with area 50.0
```

### Structs and Protocols

In Swift, structs are value types, and they donâ€™t support inheritance. Instead, you can use protocols to define shared behavior and then conform structs to those protocols. This approach promotes composition over inheritance.

#### Protocol Definition

First, we define a protocol to describe the common behavior.

```
protocol Shape {
    var name: String { get set }
    func area() -> Double
    func draw() -> String
}

extension Shape {
    func draw() -> String {
        return "Draw a \(name) with area \(area())"
    }
}
```

#### Struct Implementation

Next, we create structs that conform to the `Shape` protocol.

```swift
struct Square: Shape {
    var name: String = ""
    var length: Double = 0

    func area() -> Double {
        return length * length
    }
}

var square = Square()
square.name = "My Square"
square.length = 5
print(square.draw()) // Output: Draw a My Square with area 25.0

struct Rectangle: Shape {
    var name: String = ""
    var length: Double = 0
    var breadth: Double = 0

    func area() -> Double {
        return length * breadth
    }
}

var rectangle = Rectangle()
rectangle.name = "My Rectangle"
rectangle.length = 5
rectangle.breadth = 10
print(rectangle.draw()) // Output: Draw a My Rectangle with area 50.0
```

### Explanation

#### Classes:

- **Inheritance**: Classes support inheritance, allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another.

- **Reference Types**: Classes are reference types, meaning instances are passed by reference.

- **Flexibility**: Classes can have deinitializers, reference counting, and can be subclassed.

#### Structs and Protocols:

- **Value Types**: Structs are value types, meaning instances are passed by value.

- **Composition**: Instead of inheritance, you use protocols to define shared behaviour and structs to implement that behaviour.

- **Performance**: Structs are generally more performant because they are simpler and don't have the overhead of reference counting.

### Conclusion

By using classes, you can leverage inheritance to create a hierarchy of related types. With structs and protocols, you can achieve similar functionality through composition, promoting a more flexible and modular design. Understanding when to use each approach is key to mastering Swift and building robust applications.
