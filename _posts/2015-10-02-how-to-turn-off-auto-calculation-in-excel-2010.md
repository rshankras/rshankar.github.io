In this tutorial, we will see how to disable auto calculation in Excel 2016, 2013 & 2010. **Auto calculation** in Excel is an useful feature which would automatically recalculate results based on the changes to the input values. But if you want to temporarily disable this option then you can use the settings available as part of the **Formulas** Ribbon menu.

**Step 1**: Launch Excel Application and click the Formulas menu.

**Step 3**: Select **Manual** from the Calculation Options drop down list.

Now when ever user makes any changes to excel cell values and if any formula is based on these input cells then the result will not be automatically recalculated.

There is also an option available to do **manual recalculation**.  Navigate to the Calculation section and click the **Calculate Sheet** available next to Calculation options.
