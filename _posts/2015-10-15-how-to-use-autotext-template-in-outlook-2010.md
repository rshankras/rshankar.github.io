We had already seen about [creating email templates](http://blogmines.com/blog/2011/12/01/how-to-create-email-templates-in-outlook-2010/) to avoid repetitive work in Outlook 2016, 2013 and 2010. **Auto Text** is another template like feature that allows users store **pre defined text** which gets highlighted when you start typing the first few lines of the text and pressing Enter key will automatically populate the text.

### **Creating Auto Text entry in Outlook**

You can create **AutoText** **templates** for the text which gets used very often when you are writing an email in Outlook. For example, if you send lot of emails to your subscribers then you can add some thing like “Dear readers” as a AutoText entry. This can be done by typing Dear readers in New Message window, then press **Alt + F3** after selecting the text. This would display the following **Create New Building Block** window.

You can provide a description for your new entry and click Ok button. Now when you start typing first few letters of “Dear Readers”, Outlook will start highlighting the AutoText entry as shown below.

On Pressing Enter key, “Dear Readers” will be automatically populated in the message window.

### **Manage AutoText entries in Outlook**

Users of Outlook can **manage AutoText entries** by using option available as part of Insert menu. Click the Insert menu in New Message window, then **Quick Parts** –> AutoText. Right clicking on the AutoText entries will display menu list with Organize and Delete option.

Using the **Building Blocks Organizer**, users can Edit, Delete and Insert AutoText entries in Outlook 2010.
