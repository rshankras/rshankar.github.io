If your iPhone battery needs servicing but you want to delay the servicing and still get most life out of the battery then follow this tip.

I used to turn on lower power mode manually every time after a full charge. Instead of doing this manually we can use Shortcuts app for automating this option.

Launch Shortcuts app and tap "Create Personal Automation"

In the New Automation select "Charger" - When my iPhone connects to Power.

Under When select "Is Disconnected" then tap Next

Then add Actions, use the search option to pick Scripting.

In the scripting, select "Set Lower Power Mode"

Turn On the Lower Power Mode

Also make sure to turn off the "Ask Before Running".

This will not prompt you before running the Automation.

The newly added Automation will be available under the Personal section.
