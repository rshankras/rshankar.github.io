One of the common error that occurs in Xcode is "Error were encounted while preparing your device for development. Please check the Devices and Simulators Window." I have noticed this error after Mac OS update or Xcode app update Trying the following

1. Restart your device,
2. Close Xcode and try re-running the Xcode project.

Sometimes after restarting the device you might see the following "iPhone is Busy: Making iPhone ready for development". Give some time for the device after a restart, this might fix the problem.
