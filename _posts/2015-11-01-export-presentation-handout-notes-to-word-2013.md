**PowerPoint 2016 & 2013** users can use the **export** feature to **create handout notes** for their presentation in Word. This is quite useful when you want to quickly take print out of your presentation notes for all your audience.

**Step 1**: Open the presentation in PowerPoint 2013, click File menu and select Export option from the menu list.

This should display the following **Send to Microsoft Word** window.

Since I want only the text, I have gone with Outline only option.

**Step 4**: Click OK button to start exporting the presentation from PowerPoint to Microsoft Word.

This should launch a new word document with content from PowerPoint Presentation.
