**Microsoft Word** users can find out character count of a document using the option available as part of the **Review** menu.

This should display the following **Word Count Statistics** along with Characters (no spaces) and Character (with spaces) details. If you are interested to find out only the Characters Count of certain paragraph then all you need to do is Select the Paragraph before clicking the Word Count option.

If you only want to see the number of words in the document then the quickest way to do this is by checking the Status bar.

The status bar in Word 2013 would by default display the Word Count and in case if it not displayed then right click on the **Status bar** and choose the Word Count in **Customize Status Bar** menu list.
