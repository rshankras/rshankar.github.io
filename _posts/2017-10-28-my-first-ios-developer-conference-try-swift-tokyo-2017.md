Attending conference is one way of keeping yourself up to date with the latest trends in any industry. This is true for every software developer as well. After re-skilling myself and picking up iOS development I wanted to attend some good conferences but not many were happening in India. Heard a lot about try! Swift from [Alvin](https://twitter.com/speaktoalvin) and [Giridharan](https://twitter.com/giridharvc7) and registered for [try! Swift Tokyo](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/tokyo/en/).

### Conference

I needed a visa to travel to Japan and the organisers were quick to help me out. Thanks to [Katsumi](https://twitter.com/k_katsumi?lang=en) and [Natasha](https://twitter.com/natashatherobot) for the paper work, the level of commitment shown to sort this out gave me a glimpse of what to expect in the conference.

I had arrived a day earlier and was able to attend the Tokyo Skytree tour followed by a reception at Pivotal labs arranged for all the international attendees. This was like an ice breaker and I got introduced to few of the attendees and speakers as well.

The conference was for 2 days + 1 day for workshops and hackathon. Each session was scheduled for 25 minutes followed by office hours with the speaker where you get a chance to clarify your queries and have detailed discussion with some [renowned speakers](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/tokyo/en/). They had also scheduled lighning talks with duration of 5 minutes each. This was a huge conference with 700+ attendess, great speakers and well organised one as well.

### Hackathon and Workshop

After the 2 day conference all the attendees had a chance to participate in hackathon. This gave me a chance to work with some bright Japanese developers. There were also some workshops conducted by Realm, IBM, Build a cross-platform 2D game with Swift by [@ewingfighter](https://twitter.com/ewingfighter) and React Native workshop by [orta](https://twitter.com/orta?lang=en)

### Why should anyone attend?

- Networking with attendees and speakers, use the office hours after talk to clarify the queries with the speakers.
- You can participate in the social events after conference. trySwift are the best at this.
- If you are interested in job opportunities then you have chance to meet companies as many sponsors were doing recruitment as well
- Get up to speed in new iOS technologies and chance to know about some exciting startups.
- You can also participate in the local Swift and iOS community events.
- On a side note you have a chance to explore country and interact with people.

It was worth the money spent and would recommend this for all iOS developer especailly [try! Swift conferences](https://www.tryswift.co).
