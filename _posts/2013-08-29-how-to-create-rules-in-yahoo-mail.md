**Yahoo Mail** has a feature that lets users to **create filters** to move the incoming messages to specific folders. This is similar to rules feature available in Microsoft Outlook that can be used for [blocking emails based on subject](http://blogmines.com/blog/2011/10/11/block-emails-based-on-subject-in-outlook-2010/).

Let us consider the scenario where you have subscribed to daily newsletter of a blog and want to move these emails to specific folder.
