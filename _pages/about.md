Hi, I'm Ravi Shankar, an indie app developer who loves building apps for Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS).

I focus on creating apps that solve practical problems—often starting with my own needs. Along the way, I enjoy sharing what I've learned and helping others build their ideas.

## What You'll Find Here

* Lessons and insights from my app development journey
* Tutorials and tips for iOS, SwiftUI, and beyond

## Why I Do This

I believe in continuous learning and the joy of creating. Sharing what I know and helping others is a big part of what keeps me motivated.
