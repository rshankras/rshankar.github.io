Hi, I'm Ravi. I build apps for Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS).

I love creating apps that solve my own needs, and I enjoy sharing what I learn along the way. Teaching and mentoring others is something I'm passionate about.

I believe in continuous learning and always try to improve my skills.
